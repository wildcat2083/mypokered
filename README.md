# Pokémon Red and Blue

This is a disassembly of Pokémon Red and Blue.

Credit for the debug.asm and other tweaks goes to dannye and others who have helped me learn to modify the project

if you want an easy installer option, move mon.sh outside of the "mypokered" folder and run it in linux shell

A Pre-Built ROM can be found Here  https://github.com/wildcat2083/mypokered/releases
